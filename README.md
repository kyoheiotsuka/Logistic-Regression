# Logistic-Regression

Simple implementation of logistic regression.

LogisticRegression class is carefully written with minimum amount of coding for simplicity, however basic statistics such as deviance, residual deviance and AIC are also provided just like the lm function in R package.

## Sample Code

Sample code for classification is provided using data from https://github.com/SaveTheRbtz/ml-class/blob/master/ex2/ex2data1.txt.
Only two variables are used for fitting and predicting label here but the class can adapt to any variable numbers and data size.
